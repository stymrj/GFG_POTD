/*
Given two numbers a and b. In one operation you can pick any non negative integer x and either of a or b. Now if you picked a then replace a with a&x else if you picked b then replace b with b&x.
Return the minimum number of operation required to make a and b equal.
Note: Here & represents bitwise AND operation.
Example 1:
Input:
a = 5, b = 12
Output:
2
Explanantion:
In first operation replace 
a = a&4 = 4
after that replace 
b = b&6 = 4
Hence both are same after applying two
operations.
Example 2:
Input: 
a = 100, b = 100
Output: 
0
Explanation: 
Already same.
Your Task:
You don't need to read, input, or print anything. Your task is to complete the function solve( ), which takes two integers a and b as input parameters and returns the answer.
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
0 â‰¤ a, b â‰¤ 109
